# The Invisible Pen

The aim of the project is to try and convert any computer screen into a touch screen using computer vision algorithms. With remote communication becoming more popular such a technology helps remove barriers to express ideas freely on a virtual whiteboard without the need for a mouse. A regular pen or any pointer object can be used to draw on your laptop screen, without any ink! The algorithm tracks the position of your pointer and sends signals to the browser to mimic a mouse move.

## Demos

Basic demo showing how the custom detection model detects the whiteboard (compute screen) and a marker on a set of images completely in browser using tensorflow-js. It can be reproduced from [this version](https://github.com/Nithanaroy/invisible_pen/blob/0853ec31644213fd57a40fa03ff28e35ea2199da/static-wb-detection.html) of the project using a simple HTTP server.
